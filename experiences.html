                                This activity involved us hiking in a park and taking pictures of the nature around us. This was a new experience for me, as I only go hiking with my family a couple of times a year, and never in a group such as this one. It was also new for me, as I do not often take pictures of nature, so it was a fun thing for me to try out. Planning the experience was not as smooth as I would have hoped for it to be, but it was effective, we all were able to get there, and it was fairly well planned for a first CAS experience. Working as a group definitely made the experience more enjoyable, as it was pleasing to share the experience with a group of close friends. Additionally, working with a group on this made it much easier to follow through with the plan allowing everyone to have a better time than we would have had we done it alone. Overall I feel as though it was a great experience to grow, and learn more about nature, photography, and hiking as a whole. This experience is definitely one that I would consider doing a second time, and many more beyond that.

                                This experience was a fun and new experience unlike anything I have ever done before. In band, I have always played the school concerts with the whole band and marched during half time, but I had never done something planned by me, with only a few other people, and outside of the school setting. I did not expect a number of the challenges that I faced, but the skills I developed from them are tremendously valuable for a musician and a leader. It was also fairly scary to go to a restaurant and play for random people, but it was a really rewarding experience. There is no doubt in my mind that I want to do something like this again with the same group. Additionally, I feel as though there are a number of improvements that I could do the second time, primarily better scheduling and fixing some of the music scoring issues. We did three rehearsals as a group, all of which were very close to each other, and I could tell that the amount of work was tiring some of the members of the group. Next time, I would space things out a lot more to give much more breathing room for the members. Overall, this was a fantastic experience.

When I was in eighth grade, I worked out hours everyday for weeks at a camp, yet I have not really gotten back into the activity since, and it has been something that I am interested in. I feel as though exercise is one of the best ways to maximize both your physical and mental health, so incorporating it more into my life is an important thing to do. Doing this was a good way to break the ice and jump into the water, and I hope that I can continue to engage in this activity. Over time, I hope that engaging more in this activity will allow me to improve myself. I was surprised at how much I actually enjoyed the activity, as I kind of expected it to be either boring or painful. In addition to working out in the gym, I also went on a walk afterward to cool down, and I really enjoyed that because of how relaxing it was. Even if in the future I am not able to regularly exercise, I think that walking and/or running could be a good way to get into the activity and engage with activity.                             </div>

                                Overall, the event was very enjoyable, and I would do it again. When we arrived, we did a quick warmup/rehearsal to prepare for the day, then began to head outside to the run. When we got there, we played the National Anthem before they sent everyone off running. During the run, we played a number of songs over the course of the run and kept up the energy. After this, we went to play the Anthem again for another group, then proceeded to head back to the band hall to pack up. The band was enjoyable to work with, and we were all able to do our part to efficiently do all that we needed to do. I have personally never been to an event like this, so it was interesting to see how all of this worked, and it felt nice to be contributing to an event that I knew had great significance to many people. Once again, the whole thing was very fun, and I enjoyed playing music, interacting with people, and being a part of such a special event.

I loved watching puffs, and I plan on attending a number of the school's theater productions from this point forward. I myself take a particular interest in this topic, as I am very fascinated with live tech. Watching all of the tech/crew elements that were implemented in this production has intrigued me, and following the conclusion of marching band, I would love to get involved in the schoolâ€™s theater production. I have experience in this field, having volunteered as a lighting designer for years at a number of organizations, and now pursuing a job as a designer. However, I have never done anything from the theater perspective, so seeing this was quite eye opening to the possibilities of theater tech. Besides that I have gained a deeper appreciation for the theater arts in this experience, as seeing my friends on the stage, giving it their all, really convinced me of the value it has to so many people. I'm honestly a bit disappointed I didn't come to this realization sooner, and did not get involved much earlier. In conclusion, this has been one of my favorite CAS experiences, and I hope to provide an update later in the year with another theater related CAS experience, this time on the other side of the production.

	I enjoyed this activity more than I had anticipated, as I slightly expected that I would get bored when mediating. Thankfully, however, I was able to connect with the activity well, and I found the process of learning how to meditate for the first time to be very enlightening. Before my first meditation, I expected that it would be all about not thinking at all and forcing the mind to be as blank as possible, however, much of it focused on noticing the sensations of the body, and allowed for the mind to wander at times. The meditation generally cycled between mind wandering, focusing on the body, and focusing on the breath, which was something that I did not expect. I found it interesting to see where my mind naturally went off to, noticing the random things that would pop into my mind. Additionally, paying attention to the various sensations of the body felt very introspective, and it revealed many feelings that I had never considered. As a whole, I rather enjoyed this activity, and although Mr. Parsons will no longer be hosting IB Mindful, I will still try to find meditative outlets.                             </div>

In this experience, I went to the Houston Botanic Garden, looking at all of the art exhibits and nature. This was a creative experience as I was looking at all the art, but it was also an activity as I was walking around a lot to see it all. I loved seeing all of the unique modern art pieces, as they were not like anything that I had seen before. It made me consider the different perspectives of the artists who created them, as well as their cultures that they pulled from. Additionally, some of the exhibits were more centered around a fun idea, like lego sculptures or wooden fountains. The variety at the garden was really fun. Furthermore, I saw much nature and wildlife, which led to me considering the ethical implications of our environmental choices on locations such as this and others alike. It is very important that we preserve these sites in order to preserve the planet as a whole. I would definitely return to this location again, as it was a great experience.
