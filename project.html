                                This project aims to hold a chess tournament for local schools from grades k-12. By doing this, we hope that we will be able to encourage intellectual activity among younger students. Additionally, I hope that we will be able to raise money in order to purchase chess tables for a local park and fund our chess club. I know how impactful this project has the capacity to be, as I participated in a district chess tournament when I was in elementary school. This was always one of my favorite parts of the year, so I hope I will be able to share this experience with others.

                                There are many things that need to be set up weeks before the event occurs. Firstly, we need to decide on a location for it to take place. We had originally planned to use the cafeteria, but this will be used for a different thing on the same day. Instead, we will use the library as a waiting area and classrooms for the games. To get people signed up, we will use an online rsvp service. This will also allow us to easily collect funds online. We are sending many emails to schools in the surrounding area, though we primarily get interest from elementary students. Christian and I will be in charge of programming the software that will be used to pair the players, and Megan and Mr. Finley will be in charge of the volunteers. We will need about 20 volunteers for 2 shifts, so we are contacting honors societies and IB and providing service hours.

                            <div class="project-subtitle">
                                In the days coming up to the tournament, Christian and I began testing the program with a large scale tournament. We entered our four divisions, with all the players that had signed up at that point, and ran a few rounds. Thankfully, the program we had made worked really well, and there were no major problems. We then saved the file with all the names so we could pull it up on the tournament day. By this time, we had around 150 players signed up, which was amazing and far more than we expected. We had plenty of volunteers signed up and even received free trophies from a community member.

                                The tournament went better than I could have ever imagined. We had over 200 people show up, with tons of players ready to compete. I still remember walking into the library to see the massive amount of people at my tournament, a completely surreal experience. With all these people came the largest issue of the entire day, processing, as getting everyone in the tournament program, and taking out those who did not show up, was time consuming, and we actually started late. Because of this, next time we will be more strict with our arrival time and cut off. When we first posted the players’ room numbers, it was quite chaotic, and it felt like everything would go wrong. I’m still not quite sure how it all worked out so well, but everyone found their room and the round started after a small hitch. The room monitors helped so much in this time, and it definitely couldn't have happened without them, not to mention Megan, who helped direct all the volunteers in this madness. After the first round, everything went incredibly smoothly, and we finished the tournament in about 6 hours.

                                Overall, we are incredibly happy with the results of the tournament. We were able to raise about $1,200 from ticket sales and concessions. As of now, we have not been able to spend it on the tables, but we are searching for the best way to budget everything, as this is way more money than we expected. I had originally set the goal for $500, and the fact that we more than doubled that amount is absolutely mind blowing. We are also talking about the plans for next year's tournament, as we hope this success will continue for years to come.
