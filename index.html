                    <h2>Personal Development</h2>
                    <div>
                    Over the past 18 months, doing CAS has allowed me to develop myself and my experiences in a way that I could have never imagined. I have been able to do many experiences that are each unique and valuable, contributing to my self growth and to others. I have been able to focus on creativity with musical and artistic experiences, get involved with action through hiking, and contribute to my community by participating in local events. Overall, these experiences have cultivated the development of a better version of myself, being a well rounded individual and member of my community.

                    <h2>Benefits to Others</h2>
                    <div>
                    I think one of my favorite things about CAS was the opportunity for me to contribute to others, not only myself. My first encounter with this was my clarinet quartet performing at a local restaurant. Not only were we able to help make people's day a little bit better, but we also attracted many of our friends to come as well, leading to a fun night. Though service like this may be seen by some high school students as obligatory, I view it as a tremendous opportunity to have a great time all while benefiting those around me.

                    <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
                    <div>
                    Through many experiences, I was able to achieve learning outcome 1, as I used my abilities in music to play in the quartet and my computer skills in my project. I was also able to achieve learning outcome 2, as many of my experiences were my first time doing something like it. Learning outcome 3 was met as I helped to organize all of my events and experiences, for example the quartet, in which I arranged much of the music we played. In all of my CAS experiences, I maintained an attitude of commitment and perseverance, fulfilling learning outcome 4. My CAS project made the value of learning outcome 5 abundantly evident, as the help from others I received was necessary for the event happening in the first place. Finally, I was able to wrestle with issues of global importance and ethical issues through my Colors for Carson and Botanic Garden experiences, as these were central to the message and aim of the organization.

                    <h2>How I've Changed From IB</h2>
                    <div>
                    IB has had a tremendous impact on my life as a whole, making me a better student and person. Though many of the requirements for IB may seem daunting at first, going through the process reveals how much I can really do if I put my mind to it. From CAS to IAs to the EE, I have done things that I would never have imagined before IB. I feel that I have become much more focused, in school and in life, and that I am able to give my life a clear direction going forward.
